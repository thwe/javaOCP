In 1883, the volcano on the island of Krakatoa in the Netherlands East Indies 
begins to erupt, terrorizing the children at a mission school in Palembang on
nearby Sumatra. Meanwhile, across the Sunda Strait at her home port of Anjer 
on the west coast of Java, the steamer Batavia Queen, under the command of 
Captain Chris Hanson (Maximilian Schell), takes aboard passengers and cargo,
including a diving bell and a balloon. Among the passengers coming aboard 
are Douglas Rigby (John Leyton), the designer, owner, and operator of the
diving bell; Giovanni Borghese (Rossano Brazzi) and his son Leoncavallo 
(Sal Mineo), who own and operate the balloon as "The Flying Borgheses;"
Harry Connerly (Brian Keith), a diver; Connerly's mistress Charley Adams
(Barbara Werle), who is a professional soprano and former saloon hostess;
four female Japanese pearl divers led by Toshi (Jacqui Chan); and Laura
Travis (Diane Baker), a married woman who had an extramarital affair with
Hanson in Batavia.
